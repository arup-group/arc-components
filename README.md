At Arup we build digital solution for a wide range of global clients, users and contexts.
We belive that we have a responsibility to ensure that our digital products are accessible, inclusive and usable by everyone.
For project teams who need to focus there resouces on solving complex problems, ARC provides a professionally researched set of design standards, patterns and components, along with a collection of reusable UI components built on a framework-agnostic technology. Why spend hundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch? Why make a component library that only works with one framework?
Familiar patterns help people intuitively navigate to the information they're looking for, while also helping people discover new features. If pages and features don’t share the same metaphors, people get confused more easily, it makes it harder for them to understand the features we provide.
ARC focuses on the user experience so people can benefit from using a platform that is cohesive, no matter wher and what platform they they are in. If a page behaves and feels familiar, it allows people to focus on the task at hand, instead of requiring them to parse UI that looks completely new.

With **ARC**, you can:

- Start building things faster (no need to roll your own buttons)
- Build multiple apps with different frameworks that all share the same UI components
- Fully customize components to match your existing designs
- Incrementally adopt components as needed (no need to ditch your framework)
- Upgrade or switch frameworks without rebuilding foundational components

## Inclusive and accessible design

Accessibility and inclusive design needs to be considered from the start of a project, because it deeply affects its design, how the product behaves, and how it’s built.

Adding accessibility support to a design after the fact generally turns into a difficult retrofit.

For more information, see [Accessibility at Arup](/guides/accessibility/accessibility-at-arup).

## Responsive design

Browsers are found on devices with different shapes, sizes, display qualities, and input methods, so we can’t assume a desktop-only experience is enough. Supporting responsive experiences is an essential part of developing for the Web today. In fact, making sure pages work well [on most screen sizes or zoom levels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) is an accessibility requirement as well.

**ARC** uses the term “Responsive design” to refer to design decisions that are adapted to device form factors and user preferences.

For more information, see [Responsive](/foundations/responsive).

## Design for efficiency

With ARC we aim to encourage flow, focus, and an experience that is fast and compact.
By providing a cohesive, inclusive, and responsive design, the goal is to remove as much friction as possible between the human and the software.
The design system provides patterns and components that aim towards accessible solutions that don’t dilute efficient UI interactions and focuses on responsive design that doesn’t reduce desktop experiences into mobile-first solutions. Ultimately, it recognizes the need to encourage flow by providing calm and logical experiences throughout.

## The Zen of ARC

- Responsive is better than fast
- It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
- Anything added dilutes everything else
- Practicality beats purity
- Approachable is better than simple
- Mind your words, they are important
- Speak like a human
- Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
- Encourage flow
- Non-blocking is better than blocking
- Favor focus over features
- Avoid administrative distraction
- Secure and resiliant by design
