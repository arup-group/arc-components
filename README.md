**ARC** represents consistent, accessible, and scalable digital design at Arup. Serving as a library of design principles and components that acts to guide our digital teams in building cutting-edge software tools, products and services. Standing for _Arup Responsive Components_ and acts first and foremost as a growing collaborative library of digital design best practice principles, design tokens and frontend development standards. **ARC** is built upon rigorously tested human-centred design principles, drawing on the most up to date research in web compliance, accessibility guidelines and modern industry best practices in digital product design & development. **ARC** follows the principles of ‘Atomic Design’ ensuring that the core pillars of design are built in an accessible, repeatable way and can be implemented with ease. Scientifically informed approach to developing our core design values concerning colour, typography, grids & spacing, form & structure governs how our digital teams build components that form the heart of human-centred user experience from design to development to finished products. Component and code libraries ensure quick product realisation, knowing our design foundations are solidly constructed and also fosters collaboration across various skillsets across our digital teams by serving as a single source of truth for design excellence and development best practices.
