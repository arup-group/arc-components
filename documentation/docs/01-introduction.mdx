# Introduction

Thanks to the popularity of frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React, component-driven development has become a part of our everyday lives. Components help us encapsulate styles and behaviours into reusable building blocks. They make a lot of sense in terms of design, development, and testing.

Unfortunately, framework-specific components fail us in a number of ways:

- You can only use them in the framework they're designed for
- Their lifespan is limited to that of the framework's
- New frameworks/versions can lead to breaking changes, requiring substantial effort to update components

**ARC** is built with Web Components. These are sharable and standalone pieces of code (HTML/JS/CSS) that offer visual style and interactivity out of the box. They're supported by all [modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1), they're framework-agnostic, and they're [part of the standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), so we know they'll be supported for many years to come.

## What problem does this solve?

**ARC** provides a collection of professionally designed UI components built on a framework-agnostic technology. Why spend hundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch? Why make a component library that only works with one framework?

With **ARC**, you can:

- Start building things faster (no need to roll your own buttons)
- Build multiple apps with different frameworks that all share the same UI components
- Fully customize components to match your existing designs
- Incrementally adopt components as needed (no need to ditch your framework)
- Upgrade or switch frameworks without rebuilding foundational components
