# Getting Started

> This document outlines a guide to getting started using **ARC** components in your web based application.

## Installation

Install the latest version of the `@arc-web/components` package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arc-web/components):

```sh
npm install -E @arc-web/components@latest
```

<summary>React?</summary>

If you are using React, install the `@arc-web/react` package as well:

```sh
npm install -E @arc-web/components @arc-web/react@latest
```

Follow the [React guide](./02-react.mdx) for more information on using **ARC** components with React.

##: Setup Stylesheets

**ARC** components depend upon the stylesheet in the themes directory `@arc-web/components/themes` to be loaded at runtime. Ensure that the stylesheet is loaded by your application:

Add a step to your build script that copies the contents of the `@arc-web/components/themes` directory into a directory that serves static assets by your applications web server:

```diff
+ cp -r node_modules/@arc-web/components/themes <public directory>
```

Load the stylesheet in your application:

```diff
  <html>
    <head>
    ...
+   <link rel="stylesheet" href="<public directory>/themes/index.css" />
    ...
    </head>
  </html>
```

Bundlers that support CSS imports allow you to import CSS files directly into your application's entry point. This is the recommended approach as it allows the bundler to optimize the CSS and remove any unused styles:

```diff
+ import '@arc-web/components/themes/index.css';
...
```

## Import and Use Components

Import the `@arc-web/components` package:

```ts
import '@arc-web/components';
```

Components are now be available to use in your application:

```html
<arc-button>Click Me</arc-button>
```

Import only required components individually over importing the entire `@arc-web/components` package to reduce the bundle size of your application:

```ts
import `@arc-web/components/src/components/button/arc-button`;
```

See the [Storybook](https://arc.arup.com) for a full list of available components and their documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Icons are not imported by default and must be cherry picked.
