# Forms

> This document outlines a guide to using forms with **ARC** components in your web-based application.

Every **ARC** component makes use of a [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to encapsulate markup, styles and behaviour. One caveat of this approach is that native `form` elements do not recognize form controls located inside a shadow root.

**ARC** solves this problem by using the [formData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/formdata_event) event, which is available in all [modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlformelement_formdata_event). This means, when a form is submitted, **ARC** form controls (i.e. arc-radio) will automatically append their values to the `FormData` object that is used to submit the form. In most cases, things will 'just work.' However, if you are using a form serialization library, it might need to be adapted to recognize **ARC** form controls.

## Form Serialization

When you are relying on standard form submissions, e.g. `<form action="...">`, you can probably skip this section. However, most modern apps use the Fetch API or a library such as axios to submit forms using JavaScript.

The [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) interface offers a standard way to serialize forms in the browser. You can create a `FormData` object from any `<form>` element like this.

```js
const form = document.querySelector('form');
const data = new FormData(form);

// All form control data is available in a FormData object
```

However, if you find `FormData` tricky to work with, or need to pass a JSON payload to the server,
**ARC** offers a serialization utility that gathers form data and returns a simple JavaScript object instead.

```js
import { serialize } from '@arc-web/components/utilities/form-utils.js';

const form = document.querySelector('form');
const data = serialize(form);

// All form control data is available in a plain object
```

This results in an object with name/value pairs that map to each form control. If more than one form control shares the same name, the values will be passed as an array, e.g. `{ name: ['value1', 'value2'] }`.

## Form Control Validation

Client-side validation can be enabled through the browser's [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Constraint_validation) for ARC form controls. You can activate it using attributes such as `required`, `minlength` and `maxlength`. **ARC** implements many of the same attributes as native form controls, but checks each form control's documentation for a list of all supported properties.

```html
<form>
  <arc-switch name="arc_is_great" value="true" required
    >Do you love arc?</arc-switch
  >
  <arc-button submit>Submit</arc-button>
</form>
<script type="module">
  const form = document.querySelector('form');
  form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(form.checkValidity());
  });
</script>
```

When the switch does NOT have the `checked` state, it will be invalid, as the `required` property is defined on the component. You can log the validity of the form by calling `checkValidity()`. You can also report the validity of the input element, by calling `reportValidity()`. Calling the `reportValidity()` method on the component itself will return `true` or `false`. If the component is `invalid`, the browser will show the user a relevant error message.

```html
<form>
  <arc-switch name="arc_is_great" value="true" required
    >Do you love arc?</arc-switch
  >
  <arc-button submit>Submit</arc-button>
</form>

<script type="module">
  const arcSwitch = document.querySelector('arc-switch');
  arcSwitch.reportValidity();
</script>
```

As the user interacts with a form control, its `invalid` attribute will reflect its validity based on its current value and the constraints that have been defined. When a form control is invalid, the containing form will not be submitted. Instead, the browser will show the user a relevant error message.

All form controls support validation, but not all validation props are available for every component. Refer to a component's documentation to see which validation props it supports.
