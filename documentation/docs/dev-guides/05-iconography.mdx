ARC inhreits the Phosphor Icons icon set and provides a web component wrapper for each icon. To use an icon, import the icon component and use it in your application as you would any other component cherry picked component as follows:

```ts
import '@arc-web/components/src/components/ph-{icon-name}/ph-icon-{icon-name}.js';
```

```html
<ph-icon-{icon-name}></ph-icon-{icon-name}>
```
