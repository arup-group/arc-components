> This document outlines how to use **ARC** components with TypeScript in your web-based application.

**ARC** components are written in TypeScript and can be used in TypeScript projects without any additional configuration.

```ts
import type { ArcButtonProps } from '@arc-web/components';
import '@arc-web/components/src/components/button/arc-button';

const button = document.createElement('arc-button') as ArcButton;
```
