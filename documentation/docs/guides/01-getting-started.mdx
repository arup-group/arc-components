# Getting Started

#### 1: Installation

Install the latest version of the `@arc-web/components` package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arc-web/components):

```sh
npm install @arc-web/components@latest
```

#### 2: Setup Stylesheets

**ARC** components depend upon the stylesheet in the themes directory `@arc-web/components/themes` to be loaded at runtime. Ensure that the stylesheet is loaded by your application:

<details>
<summary>Build Script</summary>

Add a step to your build script that copies the contents of the `@arc-web/components/themes` directory into a directory that serves static assets by your applications web server:

```diff
+ cp -r node_modules/@arc-web/components/themes <public directory>
```

Load the stylesheet in your application:

```diff
  <html>
    <head>
    ...
+   <link rel="stylesheet" href="<public directory>/themes/index.css" />
    ...
    </head>
  </html>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Angular CLI</summary>

Add the stylesheet directly to the `styles` array in your `angular.json` configuration file:

```diff
  {
    ...
    "styles": [
+     "node_modules/@arc-web/components/themes/index.css",
      ...
    ]
    ...
  }
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>CSS Imports</summary>

Bundlers that support CSS imports allow you to import CSS files directly into your application's entry point. This is the recommended approach as it allows the bundler to optimize the CSS and remove any unused styles:

```diff
+ import '@arc-web/components/themes/index.css';
...
```

</details>

#### 3: Import and Use Components

Import the `@arc-web/components` package:

```ts
import '@arc-web/components';
```

Components are now be available to use in your application:

```html
<arc-button>Click Me</arc-button>
```

<details>
<summary>Cherry Pick Components</summary>

Import only required components individually over importing the entire `@arc-web/components` package to reduce the bundle size of your application:

```ts
import `@arc-web/components/src/components/button/arc-button`;
```

</details>

See the [Storybook](https://arc.arup.com) for a full list of available components and their documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Icons are not imported by default and must be cherry picked.

### Typescript

**ARC** components are written in Typescript and come with their own type definitions. This means you can use them in a Typescript project without any additional setup. Import an **ARC** component and its type definition:

```ts
import type { ArcButton } from '@arc-web/components';
import '@arc-web/components;
```

<details>
<summary>Cherry Pick Components</summary>

```ts
import type { ArcButtton } from '@arc-web/components/src/components/button/arc-button';
import '@arc-web/components/src/components/button/arc-button';
```

</details>

### React

React can render web components, however, makes assumptions about HTML elements that don't always hold for custom elements, while also treating lower-case tag names differently from upper-cased. This makes working with web components harder than necessary to use. React is working on fixes to these issues, but in the meantime, the `@arc-web/react` provides a wrapper that takes care of setting properties and listening to events for you. Read more about why we need this wrapper [here](https://lit.dev/docs/frameworks/react/#why-are-wrappers-needed)

Install both the `@arc-web/components` and `@arc-web/react` packages from npm:

```sh
npm install @arc-web/components@latest @arc-web/react@latest
```

Setup the `@arc-web/components` package as described above, however, import components from the `@arc-web/react` package instead:

```tsx
import { ArcButton } from '@arc-web/react';

export const App = () => {
  return <ArcButton>Click Me</ArcButton>;
};
```
