# Color and themes

## Customization

**ARC** components can be customized at a high level through design tokens. This gives you control over theme colours and general styling. For more advanced customizations, web-components can expose something called CSS `parts`. To ensure that each application looks and feels the same, these `parts` are not being exposed from the **ARC** components.

## Design Tokens

**ARC** makes use of several design tokens to provide a consistent appearance across components. You can customize them and use them in your own application with pure CSS. Design tokens offer a high-level approach to customizing your components, with minimal effort. There are no component-specific variables, however, as design tokens are intended to be generic and highly reusable.

Design tokens are accessed through CSS custom properties that are defined within the theme. Because design tokens live at the page level, they're prefixed with `--arc-` to avoid collisions with other libraries.

To customize a design token, simply override it in your stylesheet using a `:root` block. If you are including the ARC-provided theme stylesheets, be sure to import your own _after_ the ARC stylesheets so that your styles override the ARC-provided ones where relevant.

Here's an example that changes the primary color of the light theme. Note that you should use the ARC color palette, but if you _must_ provide a different color you should provide only the comma separated numbers to go inside an rgba block (e.g. `255,255,255,1`, not `rgba(255,255,255,1)` and not `#FFFFFF`)

```css
:root {
  --arc-light-color-primary: var(--arc-green-050);
}
```

## Custom Properties

For convenience, some components expose CSS custom properties you can override. These are not design tokens, nor do they have the same `--arc-` prefix since they're scoped to a component.

You can set custom properties on a component in your stylesheet.

```css
arc-button {
  --btn-color: green;
}
```

This will also work if you need to target a subset of components with a specific class.

```css
arc-button.green {
  --btn-color: rgb(var(--arc-green-050));
}

arc-button.blue {
  --btn-color: rgb(var(--arc-blue-050));
}
```

Alternatively, you can set them inline directly on the component.

```html
<arc-button style="--btn-color=rgb(var(--arc-green-050))">My Button</arc-button>
```

Not all components expose CSS custom properties. For those that do, they can be found in the component's API documentation. In the properties table, these can be found under the `CSS CUSTOM PROPERTIES` row.
