# Iconography

ARC uses the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) icon set and provides a web component for each icon. To use an icon, import the icon component and use it in your application as you would any other component cherry picked as follows:

```js
import '@arc-web/components/src/components/ph-{icon-name}/ph-icon-{icon-name}.js';
```

```html
<ph-icon-{icon-name}></ph-icon-{icon-name}>
```
