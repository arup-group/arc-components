# Server Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique for generating and serving the HTML of your components, including shadow DOM and styles, before their JavaScript implementations have loaded and executed.

You can use SSR for a variety of reasons:

- Performance. Some sites can render faster if they render static HTML first without waiting for JavaScript to load, then (optionally) load the page's JavaScript and hydrate the components.
- SEO and web crawlers. While the major search-engine web crawlers render pages with full JavaScript-enabled browsers, not all web crawlers support JavaScript.
- Robustness. Static HTML renders even if the JavaScript fails to load or the user has JavaScript disabled.

# Flash of unstyled content (FOUC)

A flash of unstyled content (FOUC, also flash of unstyled text) is an instance where a web page appears briefly with the browser's default styles prior to loading an external CSS stylesheet, due to the web browser engine rendering the page before all information is retrieved. The page corrects itself as soon as the style rules are loaded and applied; however, the shift may be distracting or even seem unprofessional. These problems can be resolved by using the built-in noFOUC() utility function as shown below. This will only display the content once the document.readyState is equal to 'complete'.

```html
<body>
  <arc-container></arc-container>
  <script>
    import '@arc-web/components;
  </script>
</body>
```

```ts
import { noFOUC } from '@arc-web/components/utilities/style-utils.js';

noFOUC();
```
