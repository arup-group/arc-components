# Server Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique for generating and serving the HTML of your components, including shadow DOM and styles, before their JavaScript implementations have loaded and executed.

You can use SSR for a variety of reasons:

- Performance. Some sites can render faster if they render static HTML first without waiting for JavaScript to load, then (optionally) load the page's JavaScript and hydrate the components.
- SEO and web crawlers. While the major search-engine web crawlers render pages with full JavaScript-enabled browsers, not all web crawlers support JavaScript.
- Robustness. Static HTML renders even if the JavaScript fails to load or the user has JavaScript disabled.
