# React

React can render web components, however, makes assumptions about HTML elements that don't always hold for custom elements, while also treating lower-case tag names differently from upper-cased. This makes working with web components harder than necessary to use. React is working on fixes to these issues, but in the meantime, the `@arc-web/react` provides a wrapper that takes care of setting properties and listening to events for you. Read more about why we need this wrapper [here](https://lit.dev/docs/frameworks/react/#why-are-wrappers-needed)

Install both the `@arc-web/components` and `@arc-web/react` packages from npm:

```sh
npm install @arc-web/components@latest @arc-web/react@latest
```

Setup the `@arc-web/components` package as normal, however, import React components from the `@arc-web/react` package:

```tsx
import { ArcContainer } from '@arc-web/react';

export const App = () => {
  return <ArcContainer></ArcContainer>;
};
```
