# Container
### `<arc-container>`

The ArcContainer is the most basic layout element and is required when using the ARC component library.
It is used to contain, pad and style the page and provides out of the box responsiveness for all devices.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Container" story={stories.Container} />
</Canvas>

## Theming
### Theme Basics
All themes are scoped to the arc-container using the arc-container[theme={name}] convention, where {name} is a lowercase,
hyphen-delimited value representing the name of the theme.
The included light and dark themes use arc-container[theme='light'] and arc-container[theme='dark'], respectively.
Every selector must be scoped to the theme attribute to ensure interoperability with other themes.
You should also scope them to :host, so they can be imported and applied to custom element shadow roots.

### Activating a theme
To activate a theme, import it and apply the theme's name to the `<arc-container>` element.
This example imports and activates the dark theme that comes with the bundle.

```bash
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/arc/dist/themes/dark.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <arc-container theme='dark'></arc-container>
  </body>
</html>
```

which results in the following

<Canvas>
  <Story name="DarkContainer" story={stories.DarkContainer} />
</Canvas>

There is one exception to this rule â€” the light theme does not need to be activated.
For convenience, the light theme is scoped to :root and will be activated by default when imported.
By default, the arc-container figures out the theme based on the users local time.
For this to work, both light and dark theme need to be imported and included within the `<head>` tags.

### Creating themes
To create your own theme, import the provided light-theme and create a separate stylesheet that overrides the design tokens
and adds component styles to your liking. Import your own theme after the built-in theme.

```bash
:host,
arc-container[theme='my-own-theme'] {
  /* your custom styles here */
}
```

```bash
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/arc/dist/themes/dark.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/my/own/themes/myTheme.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <arc-container theme='my-own-theme'></arc-container>
  </body>
</html>
```

By customizing a built-in theme, you'll maintain a small stylesheet containing only the changed you've made.
