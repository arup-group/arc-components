# Container
### `<arc-container>`

The Container can be used as a wrapper around web-components to provide out of the box responsiveness and theming.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Container" story={stories.Container} />
</Canvas>

## Theming
### Theme Basics
All themes are scoped to the arc-container using the arc-container[theme={name}] convention, where {name} is a lowercase, hyphen-delimited value representing the name of the theme.
The included light and dark themes use arc-container[theme='light'] and arc-container[theme='dark'], respectively.
Every selector must be scoped to the theme attribute to ensure interoperability with other themes.
You should also scope them to :host, so they can be imported and applied to custom element shadow roots.

### Activating a theme
To activate a theme, import it and apply the theme's name to the `<arc-container>` element.
This example imports and activates the dark theme, or dark mode.

```bash
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/arc/dist/themes/dark.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <arc-container theme='dark'></arc-container>
  </body>
</html>
```

which results in the following

<Canvas>
  <Story name="DarkContainer" story={stories.DarkContainer} />
</Canvas>

There is one exception to this rule â€” the light theme does not need to be activated.
For convenience, the light theme is scoped to :root and will be activated by default when imported.
By default, the arc-container figures out the theme based on the users local time.
For this to work, both light and dark theme need to be imported and included within the `<head>` tags.
