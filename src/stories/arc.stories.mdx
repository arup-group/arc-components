# Welcome to ARC

Thanks to the popularity of frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React, component-driven development has become a part of our every day lives.
Components help us encapsulate styles and behaviors into reusable building blocks.
They make a lot of sense in terms of design, development, and testing.

Unfortunately, framework-specific components fail us in a number of ways:

* You can only use them in the framework they're designed for üîí
* Their lifespan is limited to that of the framework's ‚è≥
* New frameworks/versions can lead to breaking changes, requiring substantial effort to update components üò≠

Web components solve these problems.
They're supported by all [modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1), they're framework-agnostic, and they're [part of the standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components),
so we know they'll be supported for many years to come.

This is the technology that ARC is built on.

## What problem does this solve?

ARC provides a collection of professionally designed, highly customizable UI components built on a framework-agnostic technology.
Why spend hundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch?
Why make a component library that only works with one framework?

With ARC, you can:

* Start building things faster (no need to roll your own buttons)
* Build multiple apps with different frameworks that all share the same UI components
* Fully customize components to match your existing designs
* Incrementally adopt components as needed (no need to ditch your framework)
* Upgrade or switch frameworks without rebuilding foundational components
