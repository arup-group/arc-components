# Server Side Rendering

Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique for rendering a web page on the server instead of the client. This is useful for SEO and performance reasons.
Currently, rendering web components on the server is not supported by any major framework. If SSR is a strict requirement for your project, you should use
the **CSS** implementation of the ARC Components.

## ARC Components (Pure CSS)

### Installation

Install the `@arc-web/components` package as a dependency of your project:

``` bash
npm i @arc-web/components@latest
```

It's up to you to make the source theme and components files available to your app.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/arc/dist/themes/index.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/arc/dist/themes/light.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/arc/dist/themes/dark.css">
```

Each component's styles are available as a separate file:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/arc/dist/components/button/arc-button.css">
```

### Usage

Usage examples can be found in the individual storybook component documentation under the CSS section.

### Caveats

Some components require JavaScript to function properly. These components will not work in a pure CSS implementation.
- **@floating-ui/dom** is required for computing positing unit values for DOM elements within the `ArcDropdown` and `ArcTooltip` components.
See the internal implementation of these components and the [**@floating-ui/dom** documentation](https://floating-ui.com/) for more details.
- **gridjs** is required for the `ArcTable` component. See the internal implmeneation of the component and [**gridjs** documentation](https://gridjs.io/) for more details.
