# Card
### `<arc-card>`

The ArcContainer is the most basic layout element and is required when using the ARC component library.
It is used to contain, pad and style the page and provides out of the box responsiveness for all devices.
You can use the [arc-navbar](?path=/story/arcnavbar--default), [arc-sidebar](?path=/story/arcsidebar--default) and [arc-bottombar](?path=/story/arcbottombar--default) components and add them to the respective slots to compose the default container.
By default, the container will display an [arc-bottombar](?path=/story/arcbottombar--default) component on mobile devices to ensure a functional and layout-friendly application.
