# Container
### `<arc-container>`

The ArcContainer is the most basic layout element and is required when using the ARC component library.
It is used to contain, pad and style the page and provides out of the box responsiveness for all devices.
You can use the [arc-navbar](?path=/story/arcnavbar--default), [arc-sidebar](?path=/story/arcsidebar--default) and [arc-bottombar](?path=/story/arcbottombar--default) components and add them to the respective slots to compose the default container.
By default, the container will display an [arc-bottombar](?path=/story/arcbottombar--default) component on mobile devices to ensure a functional and layout-friendly application.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Container' story={stories.Container} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility
ARC recognizes the need for all users, regardless of ability and device,
to have undeterred access to the websites and applications that are built with it.
Every component is built with accessibility in mind and is tested thoroughly as such.

The ArcContainer component comes with a default accessibility panel, which allows users to change certain aspects
of the website or application to fit their needs.
The accessibility panel can be opened (and closed) by pressing the `a` key anywhere within the page.
Next to that, the [arc-navbar](?path=/story/arcnavbar--default) and [arc-bottombar](?path=/story/arcbottombar--default) components
provide a default accessibility button to trigger the accessibility panel.

### Colour combinations
Each website and application should have a good colour contrast between text and background colour.
That includes links, icons, buttons and any other information on the page.
The accessibility panel allows users to change the contrast on the page.

### Keyboard-only navigation
Every component within the ARC ecosystem is set up for keyboard-only navigation.
It affects anyone who uses assistive technology, like a screen reader, to navigate through a website.
This includes a large range of people with motor, sensory and or cognitive impairments.
Keyboard users typically use the tab key to navigate through elements on a web page such as links, buttons and forms.

## Theming
### Theme Basics
All themes are scoped to the arc-container using the arc-container[theme={name}] convention, where {name} is a lowercase,
hyphen-delimited value representing the name of the theme.
The included light and dark themes use arc-container[theme='light'] and arc-container[theme='dark'], respectively.
Every selector must be scoped to the theme attribute to ensure interoperability with other themes.
You should also scope them to :host, so they can be imported and applied to custom element shadow roots.

### Activating a theme
To activate a theme, import it and apply the theme's name to the `<arc-container>` element.
This example imports and activates the dark theme that comes with the bundle.

```bash
# index.html / base.html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/arc/dist/styles/dark.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <arc-container theme="dark"></arc-container>
  </body>
</html>
```

which results in the following

<Canvas>
  <Story name='DarkContainer' story={stories.DarkContainer} />
</Canvas>

There is one exception to this rule â€” the light theme does not need to be activated.
For convenience, the light theme is scoped to :root and will be activated by default when imported.
By default, the arc-container figures out the theme based on the users local time.
For this to work, both light and dark theme need to be imported and included within the `<head>` tags.

### Creating themes
To create your own custom theme, create your own stylesheet and import it as shown in the example.
Apply the theme's name to the `<arc-container>` element.
Keep in mind that the name of the theme must be either `light` or `dark` as the built-in accessibility component can work with these properties.
The container will default its value back to `auto` when an invalid theme is provided.

```bash
# index.html / base.html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/customLightTheme.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <arc-container theme="light"></arc-container>
  </body>
</html>
```

```bash
# customLightTheme.css
:root,
:host,
arc-container[theme="light"] {
  --arc-color-primary: var(--arc-blue-060);
  --arc-color-error: var(--arc-purple-060);
}
```
